# .NET Project Estimate Generator
**Live Demo**: The project runs at the following URL: [https://glglak.github.io/dotnet-estimator/](https://glglak.github.io/dotnet-estimator/)

A simple and powerful tool to estimate project effort for .NET projects based on selected components, complexity factors, and additional configuration options. This tool helps project managers and developers get a quick estimate of project man-days and highlights additional complexities from dependencies and integrations.

## Features

- **Component-Based Estimation**: Choose from a set of .NET project components (Domain Model, Data Access, Integration & APIs).
- **Pattern and Role Selection**: Select development patterns (e.g., CRUD, Domain-Driven Design) and assign roles to each component.
- **Complexity Multipliers**: Adjust for dependencies and integrations to fine-tune your estimates based on project requirements.
- **Effort Calculation**: Calculate total effort in man-days, including a configurable 20% buffer for bug fixing.
- **Save, Load, and Export**: Save estimates to JSON, load existing estimates, and export to CSV for sharing.

## Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:
